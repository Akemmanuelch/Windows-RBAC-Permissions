# Windows-RBAC-Permissions
Implementing Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) in Windows by creating users and groups, assigning folder permissions, and managing access rights.

# üñ•Ô∏è Windows RBAC Implementation

## Objective
Demonstrate how to implement Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) in Windows by:
- Creating users and groups in Computer Management.
- Assigning folder permissions based on roles.
- Modifying and restricting access rights.

---

## Steps Taken

1. **Create Users in Computer Management**
   - Created users: `akaem`, `bobby`.
   - Assigned them descriptive names.

2. **Create Groups**
   - Created `Accounting` group and added `akaem`.
   - Created `Sales` group and added `bobby`.

3. **Create Folders**
   - Created folders `C:\Accounting` and `C:\Sales`.

4. **Assign Permissions**
   - **Accounting folder:** 
     - `Accounting` group ‚Üí Modify (no Full Control).
   - **Sales folder:**  
     - `Sales` group ‚Üí Modify.
     - `Accounting` group ‚Üí Read & Execute only.

5. **Modify Permissions**
   - Disabled inheritance where necessary.
   - Explicitly assigned or removed rights to enforce role restrictions.

---

## Outcome
- Users in `Accounting` can modify files in the Accounting folder but cannot delete or take ownership.
- Users in `Sales` can modify files in the Sales folder.
- Cross-access is restricted to Read & Execute only, preventing changes.
